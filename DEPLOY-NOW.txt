4. **DELETE** all existing files in that folder
5. **Upload** ALL files from your `dist` folder
6. **Important**: Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see CORS errors:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` is set to `https://harbi.benmina.com`
3. Make sure backend is running at https://web-production-5b48e.up.railway.app

### If API calls fail:
1. Check Railway deployment status
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Railway logs for database connection errors

### If page refresh gives 404:
1. Make sure `.htaccess` is uploaded to Hostinger
2. Check that file is in the root of your subdomain folder

### If images don't load:
1. Check browser network tab for failed requests
2. Verify media endpoint in Railway logs
3. Check CORS settings for `/api/media`
